# WARNING: VERY WIP PROJECT AHEAD!

# The Godot Prototyping Pack

TThis pack provides a set of premade assets and tools to get your prototype up and working as quick as possible.

Currently this is a in a very WIP state. (It is just a folder with assets in it). I intend to try and publish this to the Godot asset library and itch.io, but as of this moment there are still a lot of features I want to add.

The current (Todo list)[./TODO.md] doesn't include all of the features I want to add right now, but it has a rough guidline of what is done and need to be done.

If you have any ideas feel free to leave a issue suggesting it and I will see what I can do!
